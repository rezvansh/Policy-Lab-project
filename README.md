# Policy-Lab-project
Visualization and Understanding of Police Misconduct in Chicago using R programing language.
This project was done in collaboration with Mary-Catherine Anderson, Margaret Traeger and Qian Wang.
Here we created the network of police misconduct in Chicago based on complaints that were submitted. Network structure was created based on the officers that were common in complaints.  
We visualized and studied and predicted the network structure of police misconduct from spatial perspective. 

The goal of this project is understanding how social networks among police officers in Chicago are structured and might influence subsequent misconduct. 
Understanding how networks influence misconduct might provide a way to proactively identify officers who will be associated with more serious allegations, including shootings, and design interventions efforts accordingly.
